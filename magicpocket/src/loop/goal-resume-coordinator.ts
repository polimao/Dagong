/**
 * Goal auto-resume coordinator.
 *
 * Goal mode runs as a single long-lived turn that self-continues *within*
 * its own loop. When that turn ends without finishing the goal (an error, the
 * per-turn model-step budget, or a clean stop while the objective is still
 * unmet) and the goal is still `active`, nothing used to relaunch it — the
 * goal banner kept showing "in progress" while the runtime sat idle
 * (MagicPocketAgent/MagicPocket#370). This coordinator owns the cross-turn resume policy:
 *
 * - It relaunches a continuation turn after a goal turn settles without
 *   finishing the goal (path B: an error, the step-budget, or a clean stop
 *   that left the goal active) and after a runtime restart strands an active
 *   goal (path A).
 * - Consecutive *no-progress* failures are bounded with exponential backoff;
 *   once the budget is exhausted the goal is moved out of `active` so the UI
 *   stops lying. A failure that made real progress resets the counter, so a
 *   genuinely long goal keeps going as long as it keeps advancing.
 *
 * The coordinator holds no domain knowledge: every effect (launch a turn,
 * read the current goal, check whether a turn is running) is injected, which
 * also keeps it unit-testable with a fake timer.
