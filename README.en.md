Dagong is a product experiment for the future of programming: instead of starting from “ask the agent to edit code,” it starts from requirement clarification and connects requirement documents, Design drafts, interactive prototypes, implementation plans, todos, agentic work, and change review in one GUI workflow.

Dagong is for users who want to put AI agents into real everyday work. It is not just a chat client, and it is not only a CLI shell for programmers: in Code mode you can hand it a local folder for code, requirements, plans, and change review; in Design mode you can generate and iterate UI drafts, interactive prototypes, and a shared design system; in Write mode you can work on long-form Markdown, editing, and document export.

This is also why Dagong treats DeepSeek, Xiaomi MiMo, and MiniMax as the default first-class model stack, not just ordinary optional providers. Requirement-first agentic work requires more rounds of clarification, research, structuring, planning, execution, and verification. If model cost is too high, that richer workflow cannot become an everyday habit. Dagong chooses three cost-efficient Chinese model providers so the full loop is affordable to run, repeat, and refine.

Dagong includes the local `dagong serve` runtime for the desktop app. Preferences, sessions, logs, and runtime config stay on your machine; model calls use your own provider credentials. For workflows that can read/write files or run commands, Dagong gives you tool approvals, filesystem permission modes, inline diffs, and a change-review panel.

## Requirement-First Agentic Workflow

Dagong explores a next-generation agentic workflow: **requirement -> design -> plan -> code -> verify**. It is not just a chat box attached to an IDE.

That workflow is carried by three first-class modes: **Code** for real repositories and shipping changes, **Design** for UI direction, prototypes, and design systems, and **Write** for long-form documents, requirements, release notes, and essays. All three share the same Dagong runtime, provider config, approvals, and thread capabilities.

| Stage | Dagong's approach |
| --- | --- |
| **Clarify** | Create requirement drafts in the GUI and ask Requirement AI to find missing questions, research options, and shape boundaries |
| **Document** | Save drafts as `.dagongsdd/draft/.../requirement.md`, with structured requirement blocks, acceptance criteria, and requirement history |
| **Design** | Enter Design mode to generate UI drafts, infographics, interactive HTML prototypes, and a shared design system from requirement selections, so requirements become more than text |
| **Plan** | Use `/plan` and `create_plan` to produce GUI-owned `.dagongsdd/plan/...` implementation plans linked back to requirements |
| **Code** | Move from plan into todos, file edits, command execution, and change review; when requirements change, Dagong can surface affected replanning |
| **Verify** | Bring requirement blocks, acceptance criteria, plan state, and `/review` back together to answer whether the original requirement is done |

This is Dagong's most important product direction: moving AI agents from instant Q&A into a requirement-driven software production workflow. Code, Design, Write, models, planning, review, and automation all serve that line.

## Core Model Stack

Dagong optimizes for **complete capability + extreme cost efficiency**. A requirement-first workflow is longer than ordinary chat and depends on repeated model calls; first-run setup and provider settings are organized around three Chinese model providers so users can cover more agent scenarios with lower model cost.

| Provider | Role in Dagong |
| --- | --- |
| **DeepSeek** | Default text and reasoning provider with `deepseek-v4-pro` / `deepseek-v4-flash`, powering agentic tasks, planning, review, long-context sessions, and auto model routing |
| **Xiaomi MiMo** | Cost-efficient multimodal and speech entry point, covering long-context text models, vision input, ASR transcription, TTS generation, and Token Plan |
| **MiniMax** | Full media generation complement, covering Anthropic Messages text models, image generation, speech generation, music generation, video generation, and Token Plan |

This stack lets Dagong route different jobs to the right capability: fast models for lightweight clarification, stronger models for complex agentic tasks and reasoning, speech for writing and IM flows, and image/music/video generation for design and creative work. You can still add OpenAI-compatible, self-hosted, or other custom providers, but Dagong's default experience is built around these three cost-efficient model services.

## Why Dagong

| You want | Dagong provides |
| --- | --- |
| A next-generation agentic workflow | Requirement clarification, requirement documents, design drafts, implementation plans, agentic work, and verification in one line |
| Design in the same app | Design mode generates UI drafts, interactive HTML prototypes, node-based design flows, and a shared `DESIGN_SYSTEM.md`, then hands approved work to Code |
| Complete agent capability at extreme cost efficiency | DeepSeek, Xiaomi MiMo, and MiniMax as the core stack for text, reasoning, vision, speech, image, music, and video |
| AI that works on real projects | Bind a local workspace, read and edit files, search code, run commands, and inspect tool calls and results |
| Requirements that become executable plans | New requirements, `/plan`, todos, `/goal`, side conversations, thread compaction, forking, and archiving |
| Controlled changes | Tool approvals, filesystem permission modes, inline diffs, a change-review panel, and `/review` |
| Writing in the same app | Markdown file tree, Live / Source / Split / Preview, export formats, and selection-based inline agent actions |
| Remote or background triggers | Feishu / Lark / WeChat connection, local webhook / relay, and one-time or recurring scheduled tasks |
| Reusable workflows for repeatable processes | Visual "Create Loop" node editor to draw, run, and reuse multi-step agent flows |
| More than one model vendor | Custom Base URLs, protocols, model lists, and capability extensions beyond the three core providers |

## Core Features

- **Requirement-first agentic**: draft requirements, clarify and structure them with AI, generate design drafts or prototypes, then move into implementation plans, todos, agentic work, and verification.
- **Code workbench**: bind a local project folder, chat around real codebases, read and edit files, run commands, and inspect tool calls and file changes.
- **Design mode**: generate design drafts, interactive HTML prototypes, and design flow graphs from natural language, requirement drafts, or existing UI; iterate versions, preview on canvas, export, publish a shared design system, and hand designs to Code for implementation.
- **Planning and review**: new requirements, `/plan`, todos, `/goal`, `/review`, side conversations, thread compaction, forking, and archiving.
- **Controlled changes**: inline diffs, a change-review panel, tool approvals, and filesystem permission modes.
- **Write mode**: dedicated Markdown workspaces with a file tree, Live / Source / Split / Preview modes, completion, selection-based inline agent actions, and `HTML / PDF / DOC / DOCX` export.
- **Connect phone**: Feishu / Lark / WeChat IM agents, local webhook / relay support, and one-time, daily, interval, or manual scheduled tasks.
- **Visual workflows (Create Loop)**: an n8n / dify-style node canvas on top of scheduled tasks that turns multi-step agent flows into runnable, reusable workflows — rich triggers and nodes, typed dataflow, a local run API, exposable to Dagong as a tool, and bindable to hook phases.
- **Model-stack-first**: first-run setup, provider presets, and capability auto-wiring are designed around DeepSeek, Xiaomi MiMo, and MiniMax as a cost-efficient full agent stack.
- **Multimodal and media capabilities**: image attachments, vision input, speech transcription, image generation, speech generation, music generation, and video generation, enabled by provider configuration.
- **MCP and Skills**: Model Context Protocol servers and project/global Skills give Dagong specialized tools and workflows for different tasks.
- **Local runtime**: `dagong serve` provides the HTTP/SSE boundary with a cache-first agent loop, append-only event logs, usage tracking, and context compaction.
